Sadly, my LZSS implementation in Python is too slow, so you may prefer to compile your pck with --no-angou. If you type something in a .ss file that would break tokenization, wrap it in double quotes so it’s treated as a literal. I'm sure you are clever enough to use this tool without a README to guide you.

嫌我的LZSS实现太慢的话，可以在编译时使用--no-angou选项跳过。如果你在.ss文件中键入的字符导致了分词错误，尝试套层双引号寻求豁免。我相信你很聪明，不需要我教你就会用。
